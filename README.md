# Java-Projects

This is a couple of projects I completed in my Java Programing class, 2800C. 

Vehicle = In this code, we were given a basic Java object named Vehicle, this object had a couple of varibles such as; it's year, mileage, and it's Miles per Gallon. We then had to create two different vehicle instances, then asking the user how far they would like to drive. After getting user information adding their input to the total miles for that specific vehicle.
